# Black White News

Hello, my name is Valery Yanchev, I made this project for practice. This is a news site that lets you.

1. Select a country to display top news
2. You can toggle news and categorize them as good or bad news. (The idea is for people to determine whether it is good news in their opinion or bad, I was limited by the capabilities of the API, so the initial distribution is only simulated).
3. You can also leave a comment (Simulation of work - due to API restrictions).
4. You can search for news by keywords and also implemented 2 fields for setting the time interval for news search.
5. You can read the found news from the columns of good or bad news (In the concept, which should be distributed by the number of positive and negative ratings)

API Server - https://newsapi.org

## Installation

In order to test, take just 3 simple steps
1. Register on the site and get a unique
api key
2. In the src / environment folder in the file, replace the key written there with your generated key
3. Install all dependencies with -----> npm i <----- - that's all

## Technologies and tools that I used
